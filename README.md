just got out of watching henry danger: the movie, my head’s spinning like the time I rewired the Smiths’ attic while their dog was barking non-stop. this theater tho, so noisy i could barely hear the dialogue, kids yelling, popcorn raining down like confetti…

anyway, the movie! wild, right? henry flying around, like, who knew the dude had wings hidden somewhere? feels like that one time at Fred’s when we had to install those ridiculous solar panels on his roof, and I was afraid I'd just levitate with ‘em. and captain man, seriously, he’s built like one of those new junction boxes—impossible to open but full of surprises. popcorn was everywhere, btw, in my shirt, on my back, sticking to me like i'm a magnet.  

certain moments felt like a weird deja vu, like flashing neon tubes buzzing when getting switched on. kinda reminded me of the time I accidentally zapped myself connecting wires, seeing stars and peacocks in broad daylight.

> did i mention how henry’s sidekick screamed so much? like, i haven't heard that much high-pitched noise since the time I had to fix Mrs. Henderson’s washing machine at 3 AM. that kid seriously needs to chill, wonder how he deals off-screen, might want to download the movie later just to catch the dialogues I missed, you know? and the aliens or robots or whatever. they looked like those spare parts I always end up with after a job, lying around without a purpose.  

somebody asked if they should even watch the movie, and i say why not? free laughs, car chase scenes sharper than wire cutters, though my back had it rough with those barely padded seats. felt like sitting on a bare plank while balancing a circuit board on your head.

do you think the power surge in the final scene was a metaphor? I dunno, still chewing that over like last night's half-burnt toast. 

// int main() 
// { 
// Console.WriteLine(Electricity flowing but the switches are off); 
// return movies[HenrysMovie][0];
// } 

this looks more like the inside of my toolbox than code, haha! gotta go charge my phone or recharge from this whole experience, whichever comes first.
